Microtasking is a series of many small tasks which together comprise a large unified project, and it is completed by many people over the Internet.
Microtasking is considered the smallest unit of work in a virtual assembly line. It is most often used to describe tasks for which no efficient algorithm has been devised, and require human intelligence to complete reliably.
